    		polls (Additionally change Questions to Posts and Answers to Comments)

			Dark mode (MUI Theme setup completely) (Very good for the project ****)

			Google & Facebook Login
				Checkout passport google login
				Setup Strategies

# Whenever you feel like touching this :
    		Organize Api Calls
				Make a different folder for this in the frontend call it api/v1/

### Leaving For Later(V4?) :
			Profile Setup Steps
				An invisible field called firstLogin and with it we display these steps to implement the profile setup?
    		Cache Implementation
				Frontend Backend Db Backend Frontend
				Frontend Backend(Cache) Frontend
    		Have some logic for recommendation + hide disliked content
				For this every post needs to have tag (to build a good algo)
			mui-tiptap // or create my own simple MUI editor ?? 
				Basically change the look for adding description etc
				Maybe change the question to be on the main page?
			Score/Following should be clickable and give a modal with paginated users as results
