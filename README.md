## What we doing right now:

# V3 Things in priority:
    		Add relation user.notifications{ id,read:boolean,message,type,from }
    		Google & Facebook Login
    			Checkout passport google login
    			Setup Strategies
			Profile Setup Steps
    		polls (Additionally change Questions to Posts and Answers to Comments)
			
			Dark mode (MUI Theme setup completely)
			mui-tiptap // or create my own simple MUI editor ??
			Add realtime chat between users

# Whenever you feel like touching this :
    		Organize Api Calls

### Leaving For Later(V4?) :
    		Cache Implementation
    		Multi-Threading
    		Have some nlp logic to hide similar content when downvoting a post
    		Have some logic for recommendation

# Suggestions:
	Change Create Topic/Add Question Modal
	Make like/dislike/comment icons have more value (They straightforwardly look ugly)
