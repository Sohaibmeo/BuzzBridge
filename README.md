### V2 notes(If I implement them)
    Most Important:
		Lazy Loading
		Search Bar
		Google Login
		Backend Validations
		Cache Implementation
		Add relation user.notifications{ id,read:boolean,message }
		Add relation user.chats.users.messages (real time chat?)
	Worth Doing:
		Profile Setup Steps
		Add post and polls
		Have some nlp logic to hide similar content when downvoting a post
		Have some logic for recommendation
		Iphone support for videos..? (or give error that this Format is not supported)
		mui-tiptap (A lot of option but it is an another package so consider both things) // or create my own editor ??
	Low Priority:
		Email template : Using html instead of template rn (Vercel build issue)
		Improve mobile performance?
		Dark mode?
		Overall Font + Logo-Color and Design ETC
		Replace account settings button and form with MUI accordion
		Please move the api calls or some logic in functions/Seperate folder for all api calls in a nice organized way
