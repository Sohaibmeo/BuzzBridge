# In progress: V(3)

## V3 Things in priority:
	Search bar UI gotta improve this
	If the user is not the owner don't display edit/delete k?
	User Card better flexbox/ etc (Things overlap or aren't properly displayed etc)
	Score/Following should be clickable and give a modal with paginated users(like 5 users or 10 maybe) as results
